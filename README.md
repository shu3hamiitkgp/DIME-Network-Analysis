# DIME-Network-Analysis

[DIME](https://data.stanford.edu/dime) (Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections) is a data created and maintained by [Adam Bonica](https://web.stanford.edu/~bonica/), which entails monetary contributions in US Political Elections. In this analysis we focus on US Federal Elections, and try to formulate a study to understand the underlying network, it's properties and showcase how we can create a community structure based on the different ideologies amoung the contributors and recipients. This study is the term project for Network Science course (PHYS5116) I took in Fall'23 under the guidance of [Prof. Albert Laszlo Barabasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si).
